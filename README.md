# spotify-api-search
Between January and March 2020, I attended <a href="http://www.spiced-academy.com/" target="_blank">SPICED Academy</a>, an intensive 12-week coding program focused on Full Stack JavaScript Web Development in Berlin, Germany. During this program, I built a portfolio of web applications.

Project was built using Spotify API to search for artists and albums on their platform.  After a search term is passed, the app displays all the results with images that are linked to spotify.  Also implemented is an infinite scroll in case there are more than 20 results.  

## Tech Stack
